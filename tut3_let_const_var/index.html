    <h1>let, const and var </h1> 
    <p>
        In JavaScript, <b>let</b>, <b>const</b>, and <b>var</b> are used to declare variables, but they have different characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>let</b>: Used to declare block-scoped variables. These variables can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.</li>
        <li><b>const</b>: Used to declare block-scoped constants. These variables cannot be reassigned or redeclared. They must be initialized at the time of declaration.</li>
        <li><b>var</b>: Used to declare function-scoped or globally-scoped variables. Variables declared with var can be reassigned and redeclared within the same scope. However, var has some quirks related to hoisting and scope that can lead to unexpected behavior.</li>
    </ul>
