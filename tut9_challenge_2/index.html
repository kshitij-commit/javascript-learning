    <h1>Coding Challenge 2</h1>
    <p>
        Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: <br>
        <b>BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)</b> (mass in kg and height in meter). <br>
        1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables <br>
        2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) <br>
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. <br>
        Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. <br>
